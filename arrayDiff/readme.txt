Your goal in this kata is to implement an array_diff function, which subtracts one array from another.

It should remove all values from array a, which are present in array b.

array_diff([1,2], [1]) // [2]
If a value is present in array b, all of its occurrences must be removed from array a.

array_diff([1,2,2], [2]) // [1]
