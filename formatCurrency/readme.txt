Your objective is to add formatting to a plain number to display it as price.

The function should return a string like this:

var price = numberToPrice(13253.5123);
console.log(price); // 13,253.51
Numbers should use the standard comma for every 3 numbers and dot to separate the cents, cents need to be truncated to 2 decimals, in the case that the decimal part of the number is 1 character long or none you should add 0's so that the result will always have 2 decimal characters, the function will also evaluate negative numbers.

function should return a string 'NaN' if the input is not a valid number
