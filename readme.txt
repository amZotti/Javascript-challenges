My primary outcome for these challenges above all else is simply to give me a
means of generating momentum. The difficulty of these challenges ranges from
very simple to highly complex. The reason there are such varied differences in
the difficulties of problems is because I tackle those problem based on my
cognitive flexability on a given day. 

I believe that the key to peak performance is momentum and that is the purpose for these challenges. These
challenges are means for me to gain momentum at the beginning of my work
periods.

The secondary outcome of these challenges is for me to practice functional
programming. I read the book Eloquent Javascript and I use these challenges as a
means to practice the design patterns which are demonstrated in this book.
