Your challenge is to write a function named getSlope(p1, p2) that calculates the slope of the line through two points. Each point that the function takes in is an array 2 elements long. The first number is the x coordinate and the second number is the y coordinate. If the line through the two points is vertical, the function should return null. If the same point is given twice, the function should return null.
