Special thanks to W3schools for providing me with this great content.

Lessons Learned:
1) Accessing XML files locally

You won't be able to access the XML file from the HTML directly in chrome due to
security settings. An easy way around this is to cd into this directory and
launch a simple HTTP Python server, then view it from there. Use the following
command:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

2) Creating HTML content from XML 

The entire HTML page is an object called document. That is why drawing tables in
HTML we use the command document.write(...) often. Write is a method on
document. 

3) Reading from XML files

request.open("GET", "filename.xml", false);
request.send();
print(request.responseText);

4) Window Object

Many methods I assued were built into Javascript are actually methods that are
on the Window object. Frequent Window object methods are:
alert()
setTimeout()
setInterval()
print()
etc

5) Active X or XMLHttpRequest object depends on browser version

Although it seems they are essentially the same
