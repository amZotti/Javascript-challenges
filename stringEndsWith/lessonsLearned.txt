I want the following regular expression:

/(ending)$/

Where ending is a variable. I discovered that to use variables with regular expressions I must use regular expression constructors. So I tried:

var pattern =newRegExp((ending)$);

But this does not work either! This works if I do not include the grouping parenthesis and dollar sign, but I need those special characters as part of my pattern!

I tried to wrap the special characters in quotations, and also cancel them out by using a backslash, but nothing seems to work! What should I do to include special characters in my regular expression constructor?!

I asked for help and a friend told me very concisely: “You have to build a string to use the RegExp constructor“.  And then everything clicked for me.  I quickly typed out the following code:


var regexString = "(ending)$";
var pattern = new RegExp(regexString);

To my dismay it STILL did not work. And then I realized: ‘ending’ is a variable, and I must treat it as I normally would in a string. So I finally got the correct solution which was:

var regexString = "(" + ending + ")$";
var pattern = new RegExp(regexString);
